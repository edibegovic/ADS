\section{Implementation of Randomqueue}

\sidenote{Complete the report by filling
  in your names, filling in the parts marked $[\ldots]$ and changing other parts wherever necessary.
  (For instance, the numbers is the tables are nonsense right now.)
  Remove the sidenotes in your final hand-in.}

Our program \texttt{RandomQueue.java} implements the complete API.
The submission at time [14-02-2018 13:46] passed all tests on codeJudge.

The items are stored in a [circular buffer bag] in [their celestial] order.
The \texttt{enqueue} operation [respects this order] by [turning the bag upside down]. 
The [inherent swap algorithm] achieves this in constant time.
The \texttt{sample} operation uses a [random float to determine a random element by bisection] in constant time. 
The \texttt{dequeue} operation does [something arbitrary but random], [magically] even the restructuring of [the circular bag] takes constant time.
In our implementation, the iterator uses a [floating array] to remember the next [magic spell] to perform. 
Initialising the [floating array] takes linear time, advancing the iterator does [one magic spell] which takes constant time.
The order in which the elements are reported is uniformly chosen among all possible permutations by [pure magic].


\subsection{Notes}

Interestingly, we found the following use of our data structure that led to uncontrollable laughter of the bystanders.
